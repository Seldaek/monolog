### 3.0.0 (2022-05-10)

Changes from RC1

- The `Monolog\LevelName` enum does not exist anymore, use `Monolog\Level->getName()` instead.

### 3.0.0-RC1 (2022-05-08)

This is mostly a cleanup release offering stronger type guarantees for integrators with the
array->object/enum changes, but there is no big new feature for end users.

See [UPGRADE notes](UPGRADE.md#300) for details on all breaking changes especially if you are extending/implementing Monolog classes/interfaces.

Noteworthy BC Breaks:

- The minimum supported PHP version is now `8.1.0`.
- Log records have been converted from an array to a [`Monolog\LogRecord` object](src/Monolog/LogRecord.php)
  with public (and mostly readonly) properties. e.g. instead of doing
  `$record['context']` use `$record->context`.
  In formatters or handlers if you rather need an array to work with you can use `$record->toArray()`
  to get back a Monolog 1/2 style record array. This will contain the enum values instead of enum cases
  in the `level` and `level_name` keys to be more backwards compatible and use simpler data types.
- `FormatterInterface`, `HandlerInterface`, `ProcessorInterface`, etc. changed to contain `LogRecord $record`
  instead of `array $record` parameter types. If you want to support multiple Monolog versions this should
  be possible by type-hinting nothing, or `array|LogRecord` if you support PHP 8.0+. You can then code
  against the $record using Monolog 2 style as LogRecord implements ArrayAccess for BC.
  The interfaces do not require a `LogRecord` return type even where it would be applicable, but if you only
  support Monolog 3 in integration code I would recommend you use `LogRecord` return types wherever fitting
  to ensure forward compatibility as it may be added in Monolog 4.
- Log levels are now enums [`Monolog\Level`](src/Monolog/Level.php) and [`Monolog\LevelName`](src/Monolog/LevelName.php)
- Removed deprecated SwiftMailerHandler, migrate to SymfonyMailerHandler instead.
- `ResettableInterface::reset()` now requires a void return type.
- All properties have had types added, which may require you to do so as well if you extended
  a Monolog class and declared the same property.

New deprecations:

- `Logger::DEBUG`, `Logger::ERROR`, etc. are now deprecated in favor of the `Monolog\Level` enum.
  e.g. instead of `Logger::WARNING` use `Level::Warning` if you need to pass the enum case
  to Monolog or one of its handlers, or `Level::Warning->value` if you need the integer
  value equal to what `Logger::WARNING` was giving you.
- `Logger::getLevelName()` is now deprecated.

  * Fixed ChromePHPHandler to avoid sending more data than latest Chrome versions allow in headers (4KB down from 256KB).
  * Fixed type error in BrowserConsoleHandler when the context array of log records was not associative.

  * BC Break: This is a major release, see [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) for details if you are coming from a 1.x release
